# Trained Models

This folder contains saved Tensor Logic models.

## Example Models (Tracked in Git)

- **family_tree.pt** - Binary PyTorch checkpoint of a trained family tree embedding model
  - 6 entities (Alice, Bob, Charlie, Diana, Eve, Frank)
  - 32-dimensional embeddings
  - 2,240 parameters
  - Size: ~11 KB
  - Relations: parent, grandparent

- **family_tree.json** - Human-readable JSON export of the family tree embeddings
  - Useful for inspection and understanding learned representations

Generated by: `examples/save_load_model.py`

## User Models (Not Tracked)

You can save your own trained models here. They will not be committed to git by default (configured in `.gitignore`).

### Saving Models

```python
from tensorlogic import save_model, export_embeddings

# Binary format (for inference/loading)
save_model(embed_space, 'models/my_model.pt', metadata={'description': '...'})

# JSON format (human-readable)
export_embeddings(embed_space, 'models/my_model.json')
```

### Loading Models

```python
from tensorlogic import load_model, EmbeddingSpace

# Create empty model with correct config
embed_space = EmbeddingSpace(num_objects=100, embedding_dim=64)

# Load saved weights
metadata = load_model(embed_space, 'models/my_model.pt')
```

## Model File Formats

| Format | Purpose | Benefits |
|--------|---------|----------|
| `.pt` | Binary PyTorch checkpoint | Fast loading, preserves exact weights, inference-ready |
| `.json` | JSON export | Human-readable, inspect embeddings, debugging |

## Performance Reference

Training time for family tree (6 objects, 32 dims, 200 epochs):
- Boolean mode: ~0 seconds (no training)
- Embedding learning: ~0.08 seconds
- Composer learning: ~0.45 seconds

See `examples/benchmark_suite.py` for detailed benchmarks on different model sizes.
