# Tensor Logic

Unified neural + symbolic reasoning via tensor equations.
Based on ["Tensor Logic: The Language of AI"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12269) (Domingos).

Key capabilities
- Tensor equations as programs (einsum joins + projections) with forward/backward chaining
- Boolean mode (deductive, no hallucinations) and continuous mode (learnable with temperature)
- Embedding‑space reasoning and gated multi‑hop composer (learns compositions)
- Automatic predicate invention via RESCAL (no labels, no manual patterns)
- Sparse facts, AMP, batching, and a simple benchmark suite

```python
from tensorlogic.transformers import Transformer, LSTM, DecoderOnlyLM

# Build a transformer
transformer = Transformer(d_model=512, nhead=8, num_encoder_layers=6)

# Export as tensor equations
equations = transformer.to_tensor_equations()
print('\n'.join(equations))  # See the math!

# RNN with boolean mode (discrete states)
lstm = LSTM(input_size=128, hidden_size=256, mode='boolean')

# Decoder-only language model
lm = DecoderOnlyLM(vocab_size=50304, d_model=768, n_layer=12)
generated = lm.generate(prompt, max_new_tokens=100)
```

## When to Use Which Approach

| Approach | When to Use | Example |
|----------|------------|---------|
| **Boolean** | Hard rules, audits, compliance, zero hallucinations | Tax rules, medical contraindications, legal logic |
| **Embedding** | Known relations to learn, fast training, few labels | Knowledge base completion, similarity search |
| **Composer** | Learning multi-hop paths from examples | Predict "grandparent" from "parent" facts, relation composition |
| **Composer + Invented** | Fully automatic—discover structure, no labels | Knowledge graph refinement, find hidden relations |
| **Transformer** | Sequence modeling, attention patterns, language tasks | Text generation, seq2seq, attention as relation discovery |
| **RNN/LSTM** | Temporal sequences, state machines, time series | Sequential reasoning, temporal embeddings, constrained generation |
| **Hybrid** | Neural + symbolic, constrained generation | Knowledge-aware language models, attention with logical masks |

**Quick decision tree:**
1. Only logic rules? → Boolean mode
2. Have labeled examples? → Embedding + optionally Composer
3. Need automatic structure? → Add predicate invention (RESCAL)

Why Tensor Logic?
- Tiny models: 10-500 KB (vs GBs for LLMs), training in seconds/minutes
- Zero hallucinations in Boolean mode (guaranteed correct deductions)
- Learns relation compositions automatically (no hand-written rules)
- Discovers hidden predicates from data (no manual feature engineering)
- Differentiable throughout (integrate into neural pipelines)

## Core Concepts

**Tensor Programs** combine tensors (facts, relations, weights) with equations (rules).
- **Boolean mode**: Strict logic (0 or 1), forward/backward chaining, guaranteed correctness
- **Continuous mode**: Probabilistic reasoning, learnable embeddings and relation matrices, differentiable

**Embedding Space** reasoning represents objects and relations as vectors/matrices.
- Objects → embeddings (learned vectors encoding identity)
- Relations → matrices (learned transformations)
- Scoring: `score(subject, relation, object) = subject^T × relation_matrix × object`
- Composition: `grandparent = parent @ parent` (matrix multiplication)

**Training Process**: Learn embeddings and relation matrices from positive/negative pairs.
- Initialize: random embeddings + relation matrices
- For each epoch: compute scores for pairs, backpropagate loss, update parameters
- Result: embeddings encode structure, relations encode transformations, enables multi-hop reasoning

**Predicate Invention** discovers hidden relations via RESCAL factorization.
- Input: triples (head, relation, tail)
- Process: factorize knowledge graph tensor, extract candidate predicates
- Output: novel relations that improve structure learning

Core APIs (minimal)
- Program (Boolean / differentiable): `tensorlogic.core.program.TensorProgram`
- Embedding space: `tensorlogic.reasoning.embed.EmbeddingSpace`
- Composer: `tensorlogic.reasoning.composer.GatedMultiHopComposer`
- Predicate invention: `tensorlogic.reasoning.predicate_invention.invent_and_register_rescal`

Tools (see `tensorlogic/utils` and `tensorlogic/learn`)
- Diagnostics (gradient health), curriculum training, init strategies, visualization, sparse utils

## Benchmarks

Reports: Speed (train/query time, pairs/s), Memory (MB), Quality (AUC/Hits@K/F1) on family, small‑KG, synthetic scenarios.

How to ask queries
- Parse questions into a structured form: (head, relation, ?) or (?, relation, tail). Example: "Who founded TechCorp?" → relation="founded", tail="TechCorp".
- Define a candidate set: use all entities or filter by type (e.g., only People or only Products). Larger sets are fine; use batched scoring for scale.
- Score with relations, not plain cosine: use the bilinear scorer s^T W_r o (EmbeddingSpace), then sigmoid/threshold as needed.
- Rank or classify: compute scores for all candidates, take Top‑K or apply a threshold for yes/no.
- Multi‑hop reasoning: if the path is known, specify a relation sequence (e.g., [founded, develops]); if unknown, use a trained multi‑hop composer over a relation bank to learn the path. You still provide anchors (head/tail and candidate set).
- Prerequisites: entities must be registered; relations must exist (trained or invented); map synonyms to canonical relation names; truly unseen entities are out‑of‑scope.
- Examples:
  - "Who founded TechCorp?" → relation=founded, tail=TechCorp, candidates=People → Top‑K subjects.
  - "What products do companies founded by Alice develop?" → head=Alice, path=[founded, develops], candidates=Products → Top‑K objects.
- Non‑goals: open‑ended web search or free‑form QA; this is a learnable relation/path scorer over a known KB.

**Not Yet Implemented**
